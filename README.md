# Geobag Counting Project

This project involves detecting and counting geobags using the YOLOv8 model. The dataset was collected from a remote place in Bangladesh. This README file provides instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Requirements

- Google Colab
- Google Drive
- Python libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - tensorflow
  - cv2 (OpenCV)
  - ultralytics (for YOLOv8)

## Setup

1. **Mount Google Drive**: Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset and save the model checkpoints.
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the `ultralytics` package.
    ```python
    !pip install ultralytics
    ```

3. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for the project.
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import os
    from glob import glob
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import random
    import tensorflow as tf
    import cv2
    from ultralytics import YOLO
    from IPython.display import Javascript
    from PIL import Image, ImageFont, ImageDraw
    from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset is located in  Google Drive under the path:
```/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/(1) Computer Vision (2023)/yolo_data ```
